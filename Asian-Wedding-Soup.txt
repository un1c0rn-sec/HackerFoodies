-- Equipment --
* Pot w/ Lid, 4 quart, minimum
* Prep Tools (Knife, Cutting Board, Measuring Spoons, Measuring Cups, etc.)
* Sheet tray (fits in freezer, preferably, or refrigerator)
* Food Processor (Optional)
* #24 Disher (Optional)

*** Procedure ***
!! Mise en place !!
* Set up your equipment within easy reach
* Prep ingredients that need it: onion, mushrooms, bok choy, scallions, garlic, ginger (if not pre-grated), cilantro
* Use a scraps bowl. Seriously. 
  * As you’re prepping, put the peels, roots, yucky bits, or any part you’re not using as an ingredient 
    in a bowl near your prep area and get it off your cutting board.
* Put ingredients in easy to use locations:
  * I like to mix all the seasoning sauces together into one container for each part (meatballs/soup)
  * You can put all the veg in sections on one plate, or keep them separate, but get them off your cutting board as you go.

Chicken Meatballs
-----------------
-- Ingredients from above --
* Ground Chicken
* Cilantro, ¼ cup chopped
* Garlic, 4 cloves smashed/chopped
* Ginger, 2 tbls, grated
* Scallion bottoms, thin sliced (rough chopped if using processor)
* Soy Sauce, 1 tbls
* Oyster Sauce, 1 tbls
* Toasted Sesame Oil, 1, tbls
* Sriracha, 2 tsp
* Cooking Sake, 2 tsp
* Rice Vinegar, 2 tsp
* Fish Sauce, 2 tsp

-- Instructions --
1. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until well incorporated. 
  * I like to use a food processor so everything gets really chopped up.
2. Dish meatball sized portions onto a sheet tray.
  * I use a #24 disher and get about 24 meatballs
3. Put tray of meatballs in freezer; chill for about 15 minutes or until just firm to the touch.
  * This helps them hold together in the soup when cooking. (It’s a really wet meatball mix with no binder.)

Soup:
-----
-- Ingredients from Above: --
* White Onion
* Garlic, 4 cloves
* Chicken Broth
* Ginger, 2 tbls
* Rice Vinegar, 2 tsp
* Cooking Sake, 1 tbls
* Fish Sauce, 1 tbls
* Mirin, 2 tsp
* Rice Noodles
* Mushrooms
* Bok Choy
* Saute Oil

-- Instructions --
1. In a large pot, saute the garlic, onions and 1 tbls of the grated ginger 
   in about a tablespoon of oil, on high heat, until fragrant and the onions begin to soften.
    * Stir constantly. Don’t burn this or the whole soup will taste like, well, burned garlic. 
      If you do happen to scorch this, I highly recommend getting fresh stuff and trying again.
2. Add the chicken stock/broth to the pot. Bring to a rolling boil.
    * Using a lid heats it up faster.
    * You really want it ripping. We’re going to crash the temperature of the broth a few times 
      and you’ll need all the energy in the system you can get.
3. Add the firmed up meatballs from the freezer, one at a time.
    * The soup should be VERY hot at this point. Be careful when dropping the meatballs in. 
      Lower them close to the broth, and slowly, before dropping them, to avoid splashing.
4. Get the soup boiling again, use the lid.
    * The meatballs should be floating, more or less, in the boiling broth by now.
5. Add the remaining seasonings, mushrooms, and bok choy. Bring back to boiling.
6. Taste the soup when it’s boiling (CAREFULLY!) and make sure it’s well seasoned. Add some salt, if needed.
    * I usually add 2 tsp or so, but do what you like. You can always add more, you can’t take it back out.
7. Add the rice noodles and cook until they’re tender (around 3-5 minutes)
    * The box probably told you to prep and rinse the noodles ahead of time, but we want the added starch in the broth.
8. (Optional) If you prefer firmer veg, add the mushrooms and bok choy now instead of step 5. Or split them between the two!

-- Serving --
* To serve, scoop out 3-4 meatballs into a large soup bowl.
* Add a decent portion of noodles then fill the rest with broth and veggies. 
* Top the soup with sliced scallions, cilantro, a small drizzle of toasted sesame oil, 
  sesame seeds, and sriracha to taste.
